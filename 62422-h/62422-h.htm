<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p><i>Gentle readers, wet your lips, for whilst with dry tongues
thou art yearning, your obedient servant, Bilious Billy, is in
the land of liberty—personal and otherwise—basking in
Cuba’s sunny clime, in Havana, sucking soda through a
straw! Soda! Sure, soda with a dash in it. When we
grow tired of fast horses and saintly senoritas, it will be
back again to the big pines of northern Minnesota for the
fishing season at Breezy Point Lodge. You know, folk, in
the winter we Minnesotans can’t fish, as our Norwegian
friends would say.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Well, boys and girls, here I am on the
road again—just like a wandering Jew.
In making my present departure from
Robbinsdale, I didn’t know whether I was coming
to Montreal or going to Cuba.</p>

<p>The high cost of coal in Robbinsdale made
me long for summer at Miami Beach, where
there is no charge for hot rolls in the sand and
a little chicken nearby. Then again I was reminded
of having seen Willie and Mollie playing
in the sand, indulging in youthful folly.
The sand was terribly hot on Willie’s back and
the sun was hot tamale.</p>

<p>Woke up in Chicago with an ice-pack attached
to my fevered brow, and appreciating
that the United States is the land of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
liberty I hied forth towards Miami to see if I
might not be able to obtain a “wee snifter.”
Miami is now the legal home of William Jennings
Bryan and I did not have much luck in
satisfying an unquenchable thirst. Anyway, if
I did, it wouldn’t be nice to tell about. Mr.
Bryan may have something to do with keeping
Miami and the State of Florida bone-dry—which
it isn’t—so more power to him. Florida
may be dry, but in the unmortal words of our
snuff-chewing hired man, I am pleased to report
that there are a lot of “damp rascals”
here.</p>

<p>Understand the Floridians are seriously
considering Bryan for United States Senator.
Had the pleasure today of driving through the
backyard of the Commoner’s palatial home, but
all I could see was the rear door and his smokehouse.
Mr. Bryan was too busy addressing a
Baptist convention to even invite me to lunch.
Tomorrow he is slated for a Bible talk in the
city park and if I get up in time, and feel all
right, shall listen to his discourse. (Later,
didn’t get up in time.)</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">After leaving Chicago I stopped at
Atlanta for a few days’ sojourn. Here
we struck nice warm sunshine. The
Atlanta ladies are a genial lot, but their costuming
somewhat crashes with the constitutional
scheme of affairs as laid down by the
eighteenth amendment. Their hats are full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cocktails—and sometimes also their heads, I
am told. In fact, a bird of paradise plume is
quite in vogue in Atlanta.</p>

<p>The information is also vouchsafed that
some Atlanta girls are born foolish, while
others marry.</p>

<p>Overheard a rather humorous remark of a
local celebrity, Clayt Robson by name, one evening
in the lobby of the Kimball house. Robson
is a well-known Georgian lobbyist and political
boss, who is considered a power in the present
state administration. Clayt jokingly spluttered
to a group of friends that “I was twenty-one
years old and grown-up before I knew that
‘damned Yankee’ was two words.”</p>

<p>My visit to Atlanta brought to memory a
conversation I had with Cole S. Blease, former
governor of South Carolina, about four years
ago. The governor very kindly invited me to
his suite in the Selwyn hotel at Charlotte, N.
C., to partake of his private twenty-year-old
stock. While “killing” the quart of medicine,
the subject of Atlanta came to the front. Here
is the Bleasian description of the South’s
largest city, as nearly as I can remember:</p>

<div class="blockquote bold">

<p>“<i>Atlanta is a hell-hole of perdition. It
is no place for a virtuous woman or an
honest man.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot quite agree with Mr. Blease, for
Atlanta treated me royally. The girlies here
I found to be of true Southern stock—very shy
and rather demure. I once heard the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
“Pitchfork” Ben Tillman remark that the only
family tree he could boast was that the women
were virtuous and the men reasonably brave.
From my cursory observations this description
fairly fits Atlanta.</p>

<p>From Atlanta our next stop was Jacksonville.
Went for a joyride here, which ended in
a thrilling though harmless smashup. Upon
picking myself from out the wreckage, I
thanked the kindly doctor for a safe delivery.
Which calls to mind these lines by Lincoln, or
some other noted personage:</p>

<p class="dropcap">As a deer hunter, I’m a good farmer.
Spent ten days tramping the windfalls in
the neighborhood of Breezy Point Lodge
without even seeing a deer. Saw plenty of polecats,
bobcats and house cats, and nearly captured
a “porky.” I learned lots about the habits
and habitations of the northern pine animals
and finally managed to knock down a “spike
buck” (whatever that means) on the last day
of the hunting season. Must admit the buck
almost shook hands with me before I was able
to knock him over. However, I had a very
good guide, Arthur Foote by name, but better
known as “Panther Pete.” Pete has earned a
regular living for twenty-five years as a trapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and deer hunter, and I am sure that the
small buck never would have fallen for me had
he not enticed the animal to leave his forest
retreat.</p>

<p class="dropcap">While touring the San Francisco underworld
as the guest of the police vice
squad on my recent tour of the Pacific
coast, we encountered what the police considered
a suspicious party.</p>

<p>He was one of those dapper young men with
a red necktie that frequent this section of
Famous Frisco.</p>

<p>“What’s your occupation?” asked one of the
policemen of the young man.</p>

<p>“I’m a business man,” was the answer as the
young man started to trip blithely away.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said the cop. “I never saw
a business man walk like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the dapper youth, “but you
don’t know what kind of business I’m in!”</p>

<p>Thirty days for him.</p>

<p class="dropcap">During my recent rampage about the
American continent it was my pleasure
to appreciate the service of Tiajuana,
and I could not resist the temptation to contrast
this Mexican village with the Canadian
metropolis, Montreal. In Montreal I enjoyed
a bottle of Pol Roger champagne without being
a law breaker, even though it cost me ten
cents for a two by four sandwich. From Montreal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I hustled to the deer hunting regions of
northern Minnesota and found no champagne
or other imported wines, but plenty of “mountain
dew.” With all due respect to Mr. Andrew
J. Volstead, our Minnesota congressman, there
is today in this grand and glorious land of the
free and home of the brave more rotten booze
than it was ever my lot to drink in the pre-prohibition
days.</p>

<p>But to get back to my deer hunting expedition,
I must admit that the deer were scarce

Minnesota, I dropped in at the farm of
my old friend, John Foss, to pass the
time of day. I noticed a drove of hogs on his
timber lot acting peculiar. They would run
up to a tree and squeal like mad, then leave
that tree and go to another and do the same
thing, continuing in their mad scamper around
the timber lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“What makes them act that way?” I asked
John.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied old man Foss, “last winter
I had a throat infection and lost the power of
speech for a month or more and couldn’t call
them to their feed, so I taught them to come by
rapping on a post or a tree, and now the darn
woodpeckers are setting them crazy.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">On my recent visit to New York I had
the pleasure of the company of Mr. H. A.
D’Arcy, author of “The Face Upon the
Floor,” which we misnamed in past issues “The
Face Upon the Barroom Floor.” This masterpiece
undoubtedly stands first among popular
present day poems, judging from the many
requests we received from Whiz Bang readers
for its republication. To Ye Editor Mr. D’Arcy
told the history of how “The Face Upon the
Floor” was inspired:</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Away back in the early 80’s Union Square in New
York was called ‘The Rialto’ agreeable to the fact that
it was the theatrical center of America. On the corner
of Fourth avenue and Fourteenth street, a very excellent
saloon was run by Joe Schmidt and it was kept fairly
full from noon to midnight with respectable members of
the sock and buskin, and amusement promoters. One
Saturday evening in August, 1887, a table in front of the
bar was occupied by a bunch of managers. We were
combining business with pleasure, booking time and
enjoying the very excellent beer and spirits available
in those happy days. It was probably about 11 o’clock
when a mendicant shambled in and approached our table.
With a sad, husky voice, he said, ‘Gentlemen, I want a
drink.’ All eyes were turned to the derelict and someone
at the table offered one of the untasted glasses of whisky
which was quickly swallowed. Joe behind the bar yelled,
‘Get out.’</p>

<p>“The waiter in front quickly seized the beggar and
threw him out of the swinging door; to make the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
more dramatic, a rough haired terrier dog named
‘Toby’ and pet of the saloon jumped at the poor devil
and fastened on his pants. ‘Toby’ always thought it his
duty to chase poor people, and had an innate antipathy
to jumpers or pants not duly pressed.</p>

<p>“Well, several of the party got up from the table
and went out to see what had happened to the poor
wretch. He was lying on the sidewalk with his face
halfway in the gutter. We gathered him up, brushed him
off a little, wiped his face and someone went into the
saloon and brought out another drink of whisky. Several
coins were carefully dropped into the inside pocket
of his coat. This was done surreptitiously so that he
would not know the money was there until the tomorrow.
As we left him on a door step next door I asked what
his trade was and he managed to tell me he was an
artist. I held that this man was not a professional
beggar, a derelict true, but probably had once been a
talented man. The argument was taken up by several
other gentlemen in the room and waxed warm until I
got angry and with a curt “good night” bolted out of the
saloon. On my way home, I determined to write up the
story in such a way as would make my argument good
and satisfy Joe Schmidt that I was not wholly chicken-hearted.
I also was pretty sure of winning the fair
hostess to my way of thinking. As I walked along I
composed in my mind the first two lines:</p>

<p>“The measure was a happy iambic tetrameter and
fitted the story, and before going to bed, I jotted down
the first two lines which I have always found the hardest
to compose, next day I finished the story. When Joe
read it, I saw tears in his eyes. It was published in the
New York Dispatch. Joe bought a hundred copies of the
paper and sent 25 to the Buffalo Bill Co. who were playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in London and among whom both he and I had
many friends. Cody and Major Burke circulated the
copies among their theatrical friends and before many
months three vaudevillians were reciting the poem at the
big music halls, then Sam Bernard set America crazy
with it and yet after over thirty years, it is still a popular
‘act’ and wins excellent booking.</p>

<p>“I have been often told that my story set the pace
for prohibition. I sincerely hope not. If I thought that
I had helped that unfortunate law, I would walk down

Upon the Floor’ is not a temperance story, but an admonition
to the world, not to despise the unfortunate
derelict.”</p>

<h3>The Wa-hoo-wa Bird</h3>

<p class="smaller">Ladies and Gentlemen, I take great pleasure in presenting
to you the Wa-hoo-wa Bird. The only bird of
its kind in captivity today. This strange bird comes from
the far off shores of the Isle of Borneo where it rears its
young among the crannies and crags of the mountainous
coastline. Now the particular strange thing about this
bird is that it only mates once every one hundred years,
and after having mated, it crawls, half drags, half flies,
until it gets itself to the topmost pinnacle of the long,
tall, lofty rubber tree. Casting its eyes to the heavens it
cries in tones of ecstacy “Wa-hoo-wa,” which, translated
in the language of the natives, means “My Gawsch,
Mamma, ain’t love grand!”</p>

<h3>Fable of a Poodle</h3>

<p>Once there was a guy who wished that he
was a rich woman’s lap-dog, when suddenly a
Great Genii appeared before him and granted
his wish, telling him that any time he wished
to be changed back to a man, he should slip out
of the rich lady’s house and come to the home
of the Genii, in a distant part of the city.</p>

<p>Being only a dog, he soon grew tired of his
pampered life, and since he was really a dog,
the kisses and petting of his pretty mistress
failed to produce the “kick” that he had anticipated.</p>

<p>So, he slipped out of the house, and found
himself on a broad and spacious avenue, lined
with trees, telegraph poles and iron fence posts.</p>

<p>Now, that was many moons ago, but up to
the present writing, the little doggie has not
reached the Genii’s house to be changed back to
a man.</p>

<p>MORAL: It’s a poor wish that won’t work
two ways.</p>

<h2><i>Movie Hot Stuff</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">These be dull days in the movie and even
the stage world. The dark clouds of the
Arbuckle case still hang over the two
“arts,” thanks to the obdurate lady juror who
caused a disagreement in the San Francisco
trial. The pleasantly informal old days, when
Wallie Reid could run up to ’Frisco and pelt
eggs upon pedestrians from the fourteenth
floor of the St. Francis Hotel, are long past.
One simply <b><i>has</i></b> to be circumspect these days.</p>

<p>After Whiz Bang’s comments upon the way
the New York stage was getting away with
salaciousness came a police investigation of
“The Demi-Virgin,” the gentle whimsy with the
strip poker game. The farce was severely condemned
by the police commissioner—but it is
still running and to crowded houses. The risque
plays have had one or two additions since we
wrote last.</p>

<p>For instance, there’s David Belasco’s adaptation
of the French farce, “Kiki,” with a little
gutter gamin of the French music hall as its
heroine. Mr. Belasco has substituted the word
marriage for liaison throughout but the intent
is there—and the lines, oh, boy! Once Kiki remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“The men are like cats—they follows us
as though our veins were full of catnip!” Then
there is a whole act in which Kiki—posing as a
rigid somnambulist—is carried and tossed
about by the various members of the cast, all
the time dressed only in a simple pair of open
work pajamas.</p>

<p>We aren’t intimating that “Kiki” isn’t entertaining.
It is. But, the latitude they get away
with! Meanwhile the censors go on cutting
out bathing girls from our films and making
sure there is no indication ever shown that
babies are born.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Charlie Ray, spats, cane, trick overcoat
with its fur collar, et al., has been
making his first visit to New York and
not creating a ripple of interest. Of course,
friend wife was along. We saw Ray strolling
up Fifth Avenue the other day—and nobody
knew the ornate pedestrian as the simple country
boy of the films. They tell me that Ray
takes himself very seriously and left the cynical
New York reporters dizzy with his confessions
about his “mission in life.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Jack Pickford continues to loiter about
New York. There are all sorts of rumors
linking Jack up with pretty Marilyn Miller
o’ the Follies. Marilyn lost her husband, Frank
Carter, in an auto accident some time ago and
is as pleasant a little widow as the White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>

the screen. By the way, those reports of
an impending family event in the Fairbanks
family still persists. What could be nicer?</p>

<p class="dropcap">Poor Eric von Stroheim! We sympathize
with him despite his Junker
physiognomy. He is telling sad tales
of his treatment at the hands of Universal.
After finishing “Foolish Wives,” they took the
negative away from him, hired somebody or
other to cut it—and Eric came on to New York
to find out where he stood.</p>

<p>At last reports he is still trying to find out.
Overheard him in a hotel recently telling his
troubles. Now and then a tear splashed in the
soup. You see, they have taken his brain child—his
masterpiece—away and are letting some
cruel inartistic outsider cut it any old way. It
seems that Carl Laemmle, prexy of Universal,
became irate over the way “Foolish Wives” cost
money and never seemed to finish. Eric says
they put all sorts of obstructions in his way.
They locked cutting room doors, held up his pet
plans, and all that, according to Eric. Finally—whisper,
for it may only be a pipe dream—Eric
organized and armed his army of extras
after the fashion of Mr. William Hohenzollern
and presented an ultimatum. He got what he
wanted. Pause to consider the news story that
nearly came out of Universal. Suppose Eric
had cut the communication wires, tried military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
gas on the officials and made the studio into an
armed camp. It sounds fishy, of course, but
have you ever met the tense Mr. Von Stroheim?</p>

<p>At that we feel awfully sorry for him. He
<b><i>has</i></b> unusual directorial ability and he is—or
was—the one able person at Universal. And
now, after making “Foolish Wives,” which, if
it doesn’t get barred by the censors, ought to be
a whirlwind, he seems to be getting the gate.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Aren’t those morality clauses the high
minded movie producers are inserting
into their actor contracts the bunk?
Imagine the nerve. Will Rogers gave the best
summary when he declared, “Say, if any one
hands me a contract with one of them clauses,
I’ll say, you sign it first.” He is in New York
doing a turn on the Ziegfeld roof. The best
line of his act is: “I’m the only guy who ever
went to California and came back with the
same wife.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">One of the funniest kick backs from the
Arbuckle case occurred at Vitagraph,
where they had Maclyn Arbuckle (no
relation to Fatty), under contract to be co-starred
in “The Prodigal Judge,” which he had
played for years on the stage. Just as the
picture was completed, a little San Francisco
scandal broke. Vitagraph decided that it
couldn’t afford to feature Mr. Maclyn <b><i>Arbuckle</i></b>
at this time. This despite the fact that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Maclyn was a well known star before Fatty was
ever heard of. But luckily he had a sense of
humor. So he said, “Oh, well (maybe it wasn’t
exactly that), you can’t buck such reasoning,”
and let his name go into tiny type.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Hats off to a real man of the cloth. The
Rev. D. H. Jones has resigned the pulpit
of Huntington Park, California, Baptist
Church, because of the fanatical attempts of
his flock to enforce Sunday closing.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“I prefer to dwell with the worldling and be true to
my inner self than to live with the saint and betray it,”
Reverend Jones says.</p>

<p>“There is a way to make the church the super-attraction;
but it will never be done by coercing the
consciences of men. The Cross of Christ is proving
to be the greatest magnet in the world, but use it as a
club, and it will become a colossal failure.”</p>

<p>“Killed professionally, yes. But, frankly, I would
rather be a man than a minister. Character is greater
than profession.”</p>

<p>“I would just as soon believe that the perfume of the
rose comes from the polecat as to believe that the spirit
of the blue laws comes from God.”</p>

<p>“Christ whipped men out of the church, but never
into it. ‘Professional reformers’ and ‘Christian lobbyists’
at Washington may mean well, but most of them are
misguided swivel-chair heroes of the Cross.”</p>

<p>“‘Close every door except the church’s,’ cries the
reformer, forgetting that open hearts are greater inducements
than closed doors.”</p>

<p>“The doctrine behind the blue laws is this: ‘I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the right and you are in the wrong. When you are
stronger than I, you ought to tolerate; for it is your duty
to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I shall
persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error.’”</p>

<p>“All the proposed Sunday legislation is simply a
human attempt to whitewash what God designed to wash
white. To condemn movies because some things may
be objectionable is like refusing to eat fish because it
contains bones.”</p>

<p>“When human passion is subdued, when the turbulent
tide ebbs, we see that the big thing that lies at the
bottom of the opposition of theatre opening on Sunday,
is simply bigotry.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder to me how many bad things good
people see in the movies; fortunately, if you are so
disposed, you need never be disappointed. The product
of a legal religion has ever been and ever will be either
hypocrisy or persecution.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">A little white coffin rested on a small
table, covered with flowers white as the
waxen face and fair hair of the baby
child whose short life of thirteen months’ suffering
was ended.</p>

<p>A small company of kind neighbors was
present. The clergyman repeated the Saviour’s
words, “Suffer the children to come unto me
and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom
of heaven,” and told how the little life had not
paid in dollars and cents, but that judged by an
immortal existence begun here, and to last forever,
Death was gain. After the father, sisters
and brothers said “Good-bye,” the mother took
the last farewell kiss of her baby and baptized
it anew with her hot falling tears. So small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was the casket that the undertaker lifted it in
his arms, just as the mother had the sick child,
and carried it to the carriage and placed it on
the seat.</p>

<p>We entered the beautiful green cemetery,
and lowered the little flower-decked coffin in
the grave to rest until God’s “Good morning”
in the graveless, griefless home of heaven. As
I looked back, the mound seemed so small that
a child could step over it in his play, but I
knew it was higher than a mountain top to the
mother because in it was buried all her love
and hope.</p>

<p>So we left the little casket and the little
body in the little grave, feeling that this bud
of promise would be transplanted to the
Eternal Garden where the full flower would
blossom and bloom without decay.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Detroit Free-Press calls it the “Snoopers’
Brigade,” and we are inclined to
think that is a well-fitting title for the
aggregation of people who are urging the formation
of a society that would compel all men
to be spies upon neighbors and reporters upon
their actions.</p>

<p>Sometime ago a federal prohibition commissioner
announced plans for such an association,
but he immediately discovered that the people
of the United States are not ready to become
investigators of their neighbors’ conduct, in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
particular, and the project was squelched by
higher authority.</p>

<p>The courts of the country are, very generally,
excluding testimony obtained by men who
lead others into the commission of crime, and
properly; they regard such actions as a conspiracy
to break the law, which makes the
tempter a partner in the crime.</p>

<p>In a Mississippi case, where it appeared that
a peace officer induced a man to purchase
liquor for him and then arrested the man who
succumbed to his blandishments, the judge
ordered the accused discharged and the officer
held. The official was subsequently convicted
of his part in the crime, and the supreme court
sustained the verdict against him.</p>

<p>There is a very general misapprehension on
this subject and acts of the officials have been
winked at because the public really did not
know what was going on and did not realize
the extent of the practice indulged in by what
are very generally called stool pigeons.</p>

<p>The laws of this or any other state may be
enforced without making all the people detectives,
as the Snoopers’ League would have
them, or without permitting the practice of
certain classes of officials, who sometimes literally
hire men to commit a crime, in order that
that very crime may be suppressed.</p>

<h3>As It Is In New York</h3>

<p class="smaller">“On East Houston Street is the lasagne or ravioli
belt where the gay boys from out of town take the leading
ladies of the jobber plants out for a wild evening,”
writes O. O. McIntyre. “You know the gay out-of-town
man. He carries a patent cigar lighter and has a sterling
silver monogrammed belt buckle and, oh, yes, a handkerchief
with a purple border. His eyes are blue and he
wrinkles them in a merry twinkle, at least he thinks it
is a merry twinkle, but it’s just the sap oozing out. The
Leading Lady knows Broadway because she reads Broadway
Brevities and her theory of life in the abstract is that
Ladies Must Live. After the first quart of red ink, he
whispers a story the boys told him in front of the Bon
Ton Store before he left for the east. She pulls the two
gun, hair-trigger Bill Hart stuff and says ‘Naughty Man.’
To complete the evening and display the ultimate in savoir
faire he calls loudly to the waiter: ‘L’addition, s’il
vous plait garcon.’ They ride to one of the Oranges in
a quick-firing metered taxi and he returns to the McAlpin
to write the wife and kiddies of his lonesomeness.”</p>

<h3>The Bum and the Farmer’s Son</h3>

<p class="smaller">One fine day, in the month of May, a dirty old bum
came hiking; He sat down by a pig pen, which was very
much to his liking. On the very same day, in the month
of May, a farmer’s son came piping; Said the bum to the
son, “If you’ll only come, I will show you things to your
liking. I will show you the bees, and the cigarette trees,
and the gum drop heights, where they give away kites,
and the big rock candy mountains; And the lemonade
springs, where the blue bird sings, and marbles made of
crystal; you can whiff the breeze from the mince pie trees,
where the wind blows fine and frisky; and you can join
the band of Rocky Mountain Sam, and get yourself a
sword and a pistol.” The farmer’s son then went along,
listening to the bum’s merry song; and for six months
they did travel. Said the bum to the son, “When I get
done, you’re going to be a little devil.” The punk looked
up with his big blue eyes, and then he said to Sandy,
“Now we’ve been a hiking all day long, now gosh darn
where’s your candy? You put a brace on my leg, and
showed me how to beg, and you told me you were my
jocker; and you told me lies, when you promised me pies,
and you called me an apple knocker; I’m a goin’ back
home, no more to roam, I’m packing my junkerino; You
can bet your lid, that this Hoosier kid, won’t be any
bum’s punkerino.”</p>
